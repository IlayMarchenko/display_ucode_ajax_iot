# Display :tv:

**Hello everyone! This is my fourth challenge in course from Ucode IT Academy featuring Ajax Systems.**


## The main idea  ✨

**How to display information on the screen.**

## Our equipment :hammer:

* ***TI LaunchPad CC1352R1***
* ***BOOSTXL-SHARP128***

## What is my project about :open_mouth:

**On the screen and in the terminal there is always actual information about the state of the LED. LCD output:** ***“LED: on!”*** **or** **_“LED: off!”_**. **UART output:** ***“LED: on!”*** **or** ***“LED: off!”*** **with lines below** ***“[number of message] LED: on!”*** **or** ***“[number of message] LED: off!”.***

## How you could run it :running:

**To run and flash this project you could use Code Composer Studio. Note that you need to install SDK to work with the Launchpad.**
